Developed a browser-based interactive economics simulation demonstrating opportunity cost, risk–return trade-offs, and long-term financial decision-making through life-stage choices.

Life & Money Simulator:
An interactive browser-based economics simulation exploring how financial and life decisions influence long-term outcomes.

Project Overview:
The Life & Money Simulator is an educational simulation designed to demonstrate fundamental economic principles through interactive decision-making. Players progress through different life stages and make choices involving education, savings, investment, career, and lifestyle priorities. Each decision highlights trade-offs between immediate benefits and long-term consequences.
The project was created to explore how economic concepts apply to real-world personal decisions rather than abstract theory.

Economic Concepts Demonstrated: 
Opportunity Cost
Risk vs Return
Human Capital Investment
Time Value of Money
Consumption vs Saving Trade-offs
Long-term Decision Making

How It Works:
The simulation presents a sequence of life stages. At each stage, players choose between alternative paths, each affecting financial assets, career progression, and life satisfaction. Economic explanations are provided after decisions to explain the reasoning behind outcomes.
The simulation runs entirely in the browser using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

Purpose:
This project was built as an independent exploration of economics through interactive design, aiming to make economic reasoning more intuitive and accessible.
